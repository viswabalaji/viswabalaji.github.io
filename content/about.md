## Hello!

I'm Viswajeeet Balaji, a senior software engineer building large-scale AI systems at Amazon. I spend my days working on LLM inference infrastructure for Amazon Bedrock, and my evenings exploring the intersections of technology, philosophy, and creative expression through writing.

## What I Do

Currently, I'm a lead engineer on the Anthropic Inference Control Plane team at **Amazon Bedrock**, where I work on:

- **AI Infrastructure:** Building data center topology-aware GPU placement systems for efficient LLM inference - reducing capacity movement from days to minutes
- **Model Launches:** Tech lead for Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet launches, supporting extended timeouts, prompt caching (up to 90% throughput improvement), and cross-region inference
- **Model Fine-tuning:** Founding engineer for Claude 3 Haiku Model Fine Tuning, delivering from private preview to general availability in under 6 months

Before joining Bedrock, I built fraud detection systems at Amazon (2021-2023) and worked on reinforcement learning models for email triage at **Microsoft** (2020-2021), shipping features to 100M+ Outlook users.

## Education

- **M.S. in Data Analytics** (Reinforcement Learning & Deep Learning) - Georgia Institute of Technology (4.00 GPA, completed 2-year program in 8 months)
- **B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics** (Triple Major) - Purdue University (4.00 GPA, completed 4-year program in 2.5 years)

## Beyond the Code

This blog is where I explore ideas that don't fit in pull requests:

- **Technical Writing** - Deep dives into AI, systems design, and software engineering
- **Poetry** - 37 poems (2020-2023) reflecting on technology, nature, and the human experience
- **Philosophy** - Contemplating how we think, build, and understand the world

I'm fascinated by the parallels between building reliable distributed systems and understanding complex living systems - both require thinking about emergence, feedback loops, and graceful degradation.

## Research & Projects

At Purdue, I developed **PINT**, a programming language combining TensorFlow and PyTorch paradigms, and worked on precision agriculture visual analytics systems. I've also built voice-based web apps using AWS Lambda and Alexa skills, exploring how natural language interfaces can make technology more accessible.
