+++

Pacing heart dances to the symphony<br>
Placid mind thrown into unbridled company<br>
Pauses for dramatic effect, I gaze into his serene soul<br>
Pitch dark & pitch perfect, eyelids fold

Printed letters, illustrations, we understand<br>
Points conveyed by Blake, artistically land<br>
Paragraphs packed capture content & emotion<br>
Piano Sonata is Mozart's congruent solution<br>
Prized pieces primacy pale in comparison to<br>
Popular unabridged works of unfolding vision

Population of billions, a passionate pair is present<br>
Parting bread, turning pages, hearing sounds incandescent<br>
Primitive need of information indulgence<br>
Present in all domains of prevalence

Peering inside, a Cretan labyrinth is found<br>
Pattern less may the innocuous piece sound<br>
Poignance is slain by Ariadne's thread<br>
Powerful indeed is music to one's head<br>
Poetic justice; no longer feared dead.

## Commentary

**The Dwindling Appeal of Classical Music** - Songs portraying violence, estranged lyrics, and simplistic rhymes abound, eclipsing the great works of soul-reaching music. Many complain they don't like classical music because they don't understand or feel anything while listening to it. This thought needs to be changed.

**Understanding vs Appreciation** - Just because one is not able to understand something is not an excuse to say there is no appeal in it. The beauty of Shakespeare is appreciated only if one knows how to read a language and understand it. Similarly, recognizing patterns in music and following a piece requires practice and an open mind.

**The Fundamentality of Music** - Language needs to be programmed into humans during early childhood, but music rhythms and chords are already present in the brain, evoking feelings of peace, anger, and fear when exposed. This is a more fundamental programming in our brain, making the skill of tuning this ability remarkable.

**No Different Than Reading** - Listening and understanding music is no different than reading and interpreting Blake's poems or Shakespeare's unabridged works. Going one step further, it's no different than interacting with a friend, where we listen to what one says and let our mind and emotions instruct us what it feels.

**Ariadne's Thread** - Music is like Ariadne's thread that serves as a guiding light during periods of happiness and darkness, helping focus our emotions. We fondly remember songs from our childhood and remember songs of someone who passed away with melancholy. Therein lies the true power of music: to move the mountain of rational thinking.

**Alliterative Structure** - The entire poem uses words starting with 'P' to create a rhythmic, musical quality that mirrors its subject matter.
