To address of ever-growing lack of irrigation,<br>
came the Green revolution.<br>
Advanced farming technology as a substitution,<br>
to the older prevalent methods of farming avocation.<br>
Ambition and Collaboration propagated the Green Revolution.<br>
Demand had increased and so had production,<br>
thus the only solution was Green Revolution.<br>
It solved problems of financial security<br>
and introduced values of abnegation.<br>
It immensely helped in the Restoration<br>
of the Great Indian Institution.<br>
Inspired farmers of all generations and traditions,<br>
to recoil to their glory disposition.<br>
But alas such advantages of the Green revolution,<br>
it plundered the soil to destitution,<br>
removing all of its innate nutrition.<br>
But through careful approaches in implementation,<br>
the Green revolution could be a successful tool in eradication<br>
of World hunger and food demand, without soil erosion and destruction.
