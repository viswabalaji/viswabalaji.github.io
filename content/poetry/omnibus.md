Hopping on the reddish yellow C line my first time<br>
Procured a seat in the crowded bus without a dime<br>
Coerced & world welcomed to unravel<br>
Glad for I had no other means of travel

Flood of people enter in stops ahead<br>
Throughout the bus like water they spread<br>
Some moving to the reserved front, others to the back<br>
Others lay quiet, while some constantly quack

The bus is bristling with diverse tones<br>
Shuffle of newspapers, taps on phones<br>
Polite few struggle to find a seat<br>
Impolite few never choose to accept defeat

I look out only to gaze back into the abyss inside<br>
For there is nowhere for the full moon to hide<br>
I share water with a parched fellow rider<br>
Enough to make our day and bond brighter

The bus climbs uphill, its vigor drops<br>
A digitized voice announces the stops<br>
I hold on to the strap; waiting for first law to impart<br>
Hopping off now for it is my time to depart
