Crystal clear azure lake, buzz of cicadas<br>
Sunflowers tilted reaching out to the light<br>
Leaves of the big banyan tree took in the light<br>
Below sat a lass, reading from Dostoevsky's book<br>
Sheltered from the sun, in the shade of the tree<br>
Contemplating Christ and emotion

The pixels were perfect, cacophony of buyers<br>
I always yearned for a colossal TV<br>
My staring Eyes taking in the primal hues of lake, lass, tree<br>
I stood a long-time listening Chopin's strokes of sales genius<br>
Safeguarded from the sun, in the air conditioned shop<br>
Contemplating cost and benefit

Melodious words charmed, in the silence of night<br>
Wanting to cherish the sweet short time<br>
You took in a fresh breath of air<br>
Running in the park, thinking of this verse<br>
Protected from the torpor by the intimate moonlit scene<br>
Contemplating creation and death

## Commentary

**Recursive Poem Format** - This is a meta-poem where the reader is thinking about the time they were listening to this poem while running in the park. The poem describes the poet's epiphanic experience of standing in a shop looking at an image on TV. The image on the TV is that of a young girl reading a book under the shade of a tree.

### The Layers of Observation

1. **Girl under tree** - Basking in sunlight, reading Dostoevsky, taking in ideas, connected through natural shade and nature's music
2. **Author in shop** - Observing TV image, taking in materialism, connected through TV light and classical music
3. **You in park** - Running, taking in breath, connected through moonlight and this poem

### Recursive Structure

Each stanza follows this pattern:
- Line 1: Location reference, sound reference
- Line 2: "Looking out for something" reference
- Line 3: "Taking in what we have" reference
- Line 4: Describe processing of above lines
- Line 5: "Shielded from something", "with help of something"
- Line 6: "Contemplating duality of incident"

### Hidden References

**Title: "Lackluster"** - In line 9, "lake, lass, tree" onomatopoetically forms "lackluster," the name of the poem.

**Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov** - The book has the struggle to understand and interpret religion as one of its central themes, hence the reference to Christ.

**Chopin's Funeral March** - The delicate piece should instill in buyers a desire to live life to the fullest and enjoy while it is present, by buying the TV.
