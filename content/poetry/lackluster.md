Crystal clear azure lake, buzz of cicadas<br>
Sunflowers tilted reaching out to the light<br>
Leaves of the big banyan tree took in the light<br>
Below sat a lass, reading from Dostoevsky's book<br>
Sheltered from the sun, in the shade of the tree<br>
Contemplating Christ and emotion

The pixels were perfect, cacophony of buyers<br>
I always yearned for a colossal TV<br>
My staring Eyes taking in the primal hues of lake, lass, tree<br>
I stood a long-time listening Chopin's strokes of sales genius<br>
Safeguarded from the sun, in the air conditioned shop<br>
Contemplating cost and benefit

Melodious words charmed, in the silence of night<br>
Wanting to cherish the sweet short time<br>
You took in a fresh breath of air<br>
Running in the park, thinking of this verse<br>
Protected from the torpor by the intimate moonlit scene<br>
Contemplating creation and death
