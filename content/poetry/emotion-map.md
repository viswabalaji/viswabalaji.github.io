Freezing winter nights at West Lafayette, the clock ticks slow<br>
Though wind chills cradle the campus, the hearths still glow<br>
Filled with ambition, work & stress, my thoughts flow<br>
Probing deeper & deeper into existential throe<br>
Running out of limited time, for we cannot borrow

A knight with shining armor, arrives in swift<br>
Hoarding a nimbus of emotions, with all her grit<br>
With a key to unlock my inner emotional thrift<br>
For blessed she is with the art of grift<br>
To awaken my mind, stir my soul, only to drift

Anger did no good to anyone, needs to be shaken off<br>
Anticipation; soon we'll get better as a responsible society<br>
Surprise; beautiful as summer or cruel as the grave<br>
Disgust at the inadept care of our delicate planet

Trust not only the young's curiosity but the elderly's experience<br>
Fear not of constant change, for everything has changed<br>
Sadness is your doing, don't exile your success & positives<br>
Joy as pure from a boy playing in the streets of London

Now I stand by the window, attention back to the December sky<br>
Filled with stars outside and wonder inside<br>
For greyish notions have given way to colorful emotions<br>
By the alluring voice from my headphones

*Inspired by Taylor Swift's music*
