## The Digital Garden

In silicon valleys where thoughts take root,
Algorithms bloom in endless pursuit,
Binary flowers, zeros and ones,
Computing dreams under electric suns.

Neurons fire in networks vast,
Connecting futures to the past,
In this garden, both wild and tame,
Ideas grow without a name.
