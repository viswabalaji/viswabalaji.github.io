Hallowed hallways stretch afar<br>
Silence hollering back at my scar<br>
Green carpets lush & clean<br>
Secrets of time they gently glean

Amber lamps adorn the walls<br>
Casting light upon ceilings false<br>
Midnight stroll I enjoy & envy<br>
Golden hour of private thought key

Twinkling stars whisper brightly<br>
History of time they divulge rightly<br>
To be privy to God's own thought<br>
A limited privilege to aeons lost

Tired & weary I droop along<br>
Hustling towards hazy horizon forlorn<br>
A long day it has been indeed<br>
Reset by midnight; the strolls proceed
