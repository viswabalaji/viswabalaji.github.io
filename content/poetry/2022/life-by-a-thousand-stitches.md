Too cold to stand still in the foggy evening<br>
I moved around to keep myself warm<br>
Biding, time, awaiting my fashionably late dinner pals.

Long time since I had come to this part of town.<br>
My frozen mind couldn't stop to reminisce.

I walked across the ice-cream shop,<br>
I used to impatiently wait in line for.

My eyes swept across the length of the vast well-maintained park<br>
A perfect base for the glistening high-rise backdrop<br>
A perfect base for the moon's reflection

The blurry skyscrapers seemed to merge into the mist,<br>
Perfectly matching my inaccurate memory.

I missed the wide roads; I missed the quiet whisper of the evening wind on my fluttering pages.<br>
Yet something seemed off. Like a boat on dry land, I struggled to recall.

Take a deep breath, open your senses, let your mind speak to you.<br>
Quieten yourself!

The waterfall in the park was shut off for winter.<br>
Ah that was the missing sound!

It is an ecstatic impulse to stitch back the memories indeed.

I see the outline of the three figures walking towards me.<br>
Another ecstatic impulse shoots up,<br>
The mystery of dinner is solved.<br>
The mystery of qualia still befuddles me.
