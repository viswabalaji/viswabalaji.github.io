I decided to descend down.<br>
Deep down into the depths of darkness<br>
Dashing through the doorways of desire,<br>
Deeming a daring dalliance with dear Dracula.

*Do not drowse at dawn.*<br>
*Do not drink at dusk.*<br>
*Do not dare to dream.*<br>
*Drudge dust to diamonds.*

Daunting voices whispered<br>
Demanding their dolls to devotion.<br>
Drowning in derision,<br>
Dangling in distress,<br>
Destination-less drumbeats demented the dolls

Deriving depraved demons of disguise<br>
Diligently doting to deceive the deities<br>
Deities that designed them<br>
Deities that detained them

Distress downpours on the dreadful domain<br>
Disease of dopamine draws the insane<br>
Doom of, for, by democracy is destined when<br>
Death is decorated as the known devil.
