+++

From playing with sticks and stones<br>
To secretly pulling strings to<br>
Elect the new king, the makers<br>
Move in shadowy silence<br>
Like the dark side of the moon<br>
Invisible to the naked eye.

Can still lift a merry fleet<br>
Can still drown a merry child

Delicate dance of a puppeteer to<br>
Encapture the audience into fantasy land<br>
Is the pinnacle of human creativity

From king maker to match maker to<br>
Block maker we have voyaged together

Finally, the mystery of "Who gets to choose?" unraveled<br>
Faith, compassion, empathy, respect<br>
No longer needed to build trust<br>
For it is now provably in the realm of mathematical lust

Towards mechanics, reason the pendulum swings its way<br>
Away from faith, again, in a periodic way.

Would a second renaissance be sufficient?<br>
It's hard to know.<br>
At the end, the decision lies with the maker.<br>
It's all about the maker.
