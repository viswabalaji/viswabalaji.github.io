Furrowing brow foreshadowed the glean in my eyes<br>
Confused, shocked, appalled I stood<br>
Taking in the magic of reality

"Oh, I got to deal with this now. How in the world does this work!"

Thumbs twiddling, feet pacing, jaw breaking experiences later.<br>
I land on a primitive insight, a real Arachne's thread.<br>
Forced out of my comfort zone,<br>
I have no way but forward.

Deep into the tunnels, the magic starts to lose its charm.<br>
Choking feeling of helplessness released at last…<br>
Its chokehold on me.

"Woah that was it? Not too bad, could have been much worse!"

Before the entirety of magical charm is lost,<br>
More magical events rush in to fill the void<br>
Reeling the mind back into the comfortable zone of discomfort

But in rare situations of stillness and silence between these magical moments<br>
There is an insanely dense void.<br>
A void too large to fill, too large to ignore<br>
A void encompassing the nature of reality
