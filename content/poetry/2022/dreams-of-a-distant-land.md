+++

The quiet hours of the evening ignite an unbearable thirst,<br>
An aching of the ages to quench.<br>
No sir, this is certainly not nostalgia.<br>
It cannot be nostalgia for I had lost the chance to make memories there.

Spirit of a pioneer drains itself out,<br>
Locked out by the same society that heralded it<br>
By the same society that was built on it

Necessary chains of thought I followed to reach here,<br>
Now whisper incantations around my cuffed wrists.

Seven oceans away my neighbors stay<br>
Along with my family, relatives, friends.<br>
Some in harmony, Some in hostility.<br>
Some roaming under the light of newfound freedom,<br>
Rest uproaring against those.

Sorcery of the soul, the heart aches, the mind breaks.<br>
Mistake not, for that is only the land I come from<br>
Not the land I want to go from, for the shadows of the land are beyond repair.<br>
Shadows powerful enough to consume my inner light.

Despite my restrained strength, an unbecoming primal force calls forthright.
