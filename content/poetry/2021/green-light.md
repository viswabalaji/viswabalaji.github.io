I awake the next day and gaze upward<br>
Only to find the spaceships and stars missing<br>
Where did they all go?<br>
They looked so beautiful in the sky yesterday.

Father, Father where are the stars and moons?<br>
I want to see them again.<br>
Where did they leave me and go?

"Ada, I promise they'll come back tonight.<br>
I'll tell you a story then"

With a frown, I went on to school that day.<br>
I told Charles about the story of the vanishing asteroids

"But Ada, it was raining all evening yesterday.<br>
I could see huge grey clouds all over the place.<br>
My mother would not let me go out to play"

Charles is always so easily confused.<br>
It was not raining inside my house, we have a roof and ceiling<br>
There were no clouds covering the stars inside,

Those green stars as promised came out at night again.<br>
Moons and shooting stars glowed green.<br>
My father recited me the story of the last star maker for the tenth time<br>
As I kept twisting and turning in the bed, wanted to view the celestial from all angles

I knew what I had to become when I grew old.
