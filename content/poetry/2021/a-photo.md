+++

Seeing changes what you know<br>
Knowing changes what you see<br>
A photo to cherish is all that I need

Smiling faces stare straight ahead<br>
Eager eyes wait to blink<br>
To not miss the eternal moment<br>
Her hands slightly touching mine<br>
I wished for that exact frame to be captured

A frame that would rest on my desk<br>
A souvenir for a stunning summer<br>
I never mustered the courage<br>
After all I was no one, no one of relevance, yet<br>
Neither a match to her sarcasm or style

A photo is all I can bear to reminisce<br>
Anything greater that I cannot contain within<br>
A Burden imposed by wisdom prevails<br>
A Burden I wish to carry

For I am death, the destroyer of worlds
