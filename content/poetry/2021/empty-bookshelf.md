+++

Centuries and Centuries had passed by<br>
The oak had not given under the weight<br>
Of the mighty books that it encased<br>
Warren's residence was finally being auctioned

Curious eyes pored over the entirety of the living space<br>
Some attracted to relics, some repulsed by trophy kills<br>
I wandered the tall corridors, judging<br>
Wishing my attention to hook onto some fine detail

Some unique, exquisite, astonishing detail that is sure to enthrall other visitors<br>
When I share my findings with them, but I couldn't find any<br>
Either I did not know what to see or I did not know much about what I saw

Gleeful guests gushed out of the dark paneled study<br>
Their primitive hands holding great truths and epithets from a previous era.<br>
Their chattering mouths discussing the fairy tales and debates scribed in volumes they held.<br>
Their wavering eyes tracing all over the embroidered words spoken by the tomes.

My feeble feet glide into the open room<br>
Gold gilded gospels lay open for praise<br>
Finally caught my quaint eye<br>
They stood quietly on top of an almost empty bookshelf

Dozens gathered around the shelf<br>
Trying to pick the last book<br>
A treatise on the life of oak trees.

I lurched ahead to taste the essence of the archaic bookshelf<br>
The bookshelf has no possible future. The book is destined to<br>
Land in someone's hands: either mine or a stranger's.

Stronger hands prevailed as dictated.<br>
The hour was late, and guests wandered out of the arena.<br>
I was the last guest left behind.

I crept inside the bookshelf, folded my long legs and wept<br>
Now the bookshelf is complete.
