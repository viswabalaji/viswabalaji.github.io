The highway curved at sharp angles<br>
As we drove into the town in high spirits<br>
Clusters of stars dotted the otherwise abysmal sky<br>
Trees of apple dotted the otherwise barren landscape

A white glowing cross appeared into view<br>
Perched atop the lone peak<br>
It outshone the streetlight, it outshone the starlight<br>
High above the river-blue river<br>
Constantly gushing; wanting to reach its end

The cross was visible from city streets<br>
It was visible from diners we rejoiced at<br>
It was visible from gas stations we frequented<br>
It was visible from groceries we restocked from

Like Horus it cast its eye on the quaint town<br>
Protecting its folk from meandering too far<br>
From falling into cycles of rampage and ruin

Through all this the cross stands upright<br>
Glowing brighter, every single night<br>
Standing in for the sun until first light.
