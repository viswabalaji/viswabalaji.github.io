+++

Jumping frog lands into the cool pond<br>
Ripples arise; push the leaves & twigs<br>
To the far ends of the lake over time<br>
Deposit them at the mouth of the gushing river

Sloping landscapes take immediate charge<br>
Turbulent flows arise; push the leaves & twigs<br>
Through meandering miles of muddy marshes<br>
Deposit them at the void of the vast sea

Howling winds usurp the leaves & twigs<br>
Along with mighty tides they rise and fall<br>
On a distant island with roosts and figs<br>
The leaves shore up, changing it once and for all.
