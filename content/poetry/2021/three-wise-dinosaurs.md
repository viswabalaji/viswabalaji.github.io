Dinosaur, Dinosaur where are you headed?<br>
Off to the tall mountains that are dreaded<br>
Why to the volcano? May I ask?<br>
To create history with a fiery task<br>
Would your aged heart make it to the top?<br>
It must indeed, for there it is destined to stop<br>
Jumping into the pool of lava I presume?<br>
Yes. For only then would a clean cycle resume

Dinosaur, Dinosaur where are you headed?<br>
Off to the sculptor, where I am expected<br>
Why to the granite shop? May I ask?<br>
To create history with an earthy task<br>
Would your aged knees make it to the place?<br>
It must indeed, for this is not a race<br>
Any favorite quote or scripture to share?<br>
Yes. For only he will release my feet from the snare

Dinosaur, Dinosaur where are you headed?<br>
Off to the river, to be lightheaded<br>
Why so early in the day? May I ask?<br>
I feel thirsty, lazy and like to bask<br>
Would your liver really stand another drink?<br>
It must indeed, for I am at the brink<br>
Any last wishes on your mind to try?<br>
Yes. I don't want my mouth to be dry

A few millennia down the line; by the river<br>
Humans dig out a big brown rock<br>
Only to find a large dinosaur fossil embedded<br>
Worthy of awe, wonder and shock<br>
History had finally been created.
