+++

O' the one in a trance<br>
Caught in a maze of misty haze<br>
Your burdened heart beats<br>
Fluttering with senescence<br>
In a certainly uncertain manner

Life brims with a million events<br>
Some of those that make us<br>
Many of those that break us

O' the one in a trance<br>
Lilac, lotus or lilies that blossom<br>
All wash up on the same familiar shore<br>
Wilting leaves cannot begin to undo<br>
Knots tied in simple steps of four

Only the heart of Atlas shall guide<br>
the Oar of our boat through<br>
the ganges Of<br>
Wishes and Woes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flowing from<br>
Womb to Will

O' the one in a trance<br>
Leave tomorrow's troubles to nature<br>
Adore the sun rise and the sun set<br>
Adore the shadows change shape<br>
Adore…Adore…Adore<br>
Always adore the misty haze
