I am conflicted.<br>
Why am I conflicted?<br>
How can I not be in a state of conflict?

Let me think and reason my way through this<br>
But what is me?<br>
Once I ask this question<br>
I create a duality

A Me who is asking and thinking<br>
A World which is filling my senses

Thoughts are always in realm of the past<br>
Certainly not predictable of future

A man argues with image of another man<br>
Man is hurting, weary and conflicted<br>
Jealousy, Envy, Rage course through his veins

How to end this?<br>
Put an end to dual nature<br>
The observer is the observed

Think, experience, and find out for yourself<br>
For closely thinking and paying attention<br>
Will lead to a state of bliss<br>
Where conflict cannot exist

Because there is no two, but only one<br>
For only with one can there be no center<br>
The universe is infinite without a center
