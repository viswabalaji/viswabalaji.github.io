+++

Resting at the edge of the precipitous cliff<br>
My eyes gaze backward scanning the terrain<br>
I look far up ahead to the destination

A train of students come stumbling down the trail<br>
Their opinions and legs busily working

First graders in a screaming match<br>
over which is the super-best color on a toy

Fifth graders using archaic and fancy words<br>
on how the book of fiction should have ended

High schoolers in a heated debate<br>
about the upcoming basketball league

Teachers walking with bated breath<br>
Pouring out tales of spouse's troubles

I continue onwards and upwards<br>
Untroubled by other's troubles<br>
Untroubled by my troubling knees<br>
Untroubled by unchanging trouble
