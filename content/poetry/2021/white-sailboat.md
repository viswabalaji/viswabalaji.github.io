+++

Seagulls crying out to the moon<br>
I descend the staircase turns<br>
Red lighthouse wasn't tall enough<br>
To cast light on the unseemly boat<br>
Waves washing across the half lit beach<br>
I dig my heels into moist sand<br>
Pebbles and rubbles strike my feet<br>
Yet I wither in winter and stand

Looking afar to the white sailboat<br>
With its string & scars intact<br>
A glimpse again is all I glean for<br>
Yet my weary eyelids compact

*"Be at peace, little one"*<br>
I heard a whisper from the sky<br>
*"He still wishes you the best"*<br>
I stand here writhing in agony<br>
Yet to lose nothing but time's rest

Currents pull me to the distant dawn<br>
Why should I resist?<br>
For only an exodus can unify us<br>
Yet that is not his wish

"I am who I am", his faint voice lingers<br>
"I am who I am", my cheeks turn pinker
