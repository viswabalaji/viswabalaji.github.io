Tightening its grasp over my slender wrist<br>
The red band shows its prominent hue<br>
A strong color at spectrum's end<br>
Sure to raise watchful brows in an instant

*For your distant travels, I give this prosaic gift*<br>
*It will serve as God's watchful eye*<br>
*Warding away evils; granting you blessings*

*That's surely a witch's sign, folks in my country*<br>
*Shiver at sight of sorcery*

*Always love a good protest symbol, what's this one for?*<br>
*Nevertheless, I support you wholeheartedly.*

*Gosh I need a red band myself*<br>
*It is exam season round the corner*

*Is it a sign of someone you lost in the past?*

Or maybe, just maybe…<br>
I have it simply to throw onlookers off<br>
Enjoy hearing them project<br>
Because surely, I could remove it...<br>
Wars have been waged over less mystery
