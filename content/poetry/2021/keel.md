Walking across the cold hard floor<br>
Sends shivers up my slouched spine<br>
I move across to the French window<br>
Lift my neck<br>
Gaze outward at the green canopy<br>
Forest with a deep keel

Flowers and leaves twitching in the wind<br>
An ephemeral moment achieved at last<br>
I want to freeze the sand in glass

Nothing special about any single thing I see<br>
Everything is special when I see them all at once

Do I see them at once, because I am unable to see each<br>
Do I see them at once, because it's time to leave<br>
Do I see them at once, because they are the same indeed<br>
Or Do I see them at once, because I cannot see at all
