## Flip (Birth)

Heads turning down to witness the miracle<br>
Hearts warming up in renewed synergy<br>
Hips swaying along in cheery rhythm<br>
Hands conjoining to create a cradle<br>
Heels taking up all the body weight<br>
Human form rests in peace

## Flip (Death)

Tails no longer wag at first sight<br>
Thumbs pointed outward cease twiddling<br>
Tongues unsatiated by closed lips<br>
Tendons relaxed to fit to the casket<br>
Thighs unburdened by the body weight<br>
Terrene form rests in peace
