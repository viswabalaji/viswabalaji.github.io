Is it faith or fate that shapes them?<br>
I might never know for sure<br>
Is it fear or envy that shakes them?<br>
For that will surely last evermore

The eclipsed moon shines brightly<br>
In the future, for it is destined<br>
Three legged dog moans quietly<br>
Repenting, thinking it sinned

Home is where the heart is, stranger<br>
I feel; I fail; I find<br>
Hope swears on tomes from a manger<br>
Wisdom is hard to define

Golden fountains lure the blessed<br>
I preach; I praise: I pray<br>
Folded cards cut down losses<br>
Until the next time I play
