+++

Eager and entitled we spawn<br>
Vowels to spell out our wants<br>
First stride and bicycle ride<br>
Captured in a quaint polaroid<br>
Dishes done, clothes cleaned<br>
A sign of familial hygiene<br>
Outlined work, outlined sleep<br>
Wreak havoc on animal mind<br>
Friends to play with and fight<br>
More important than being right<br>
Grass, deer, tiger, Grass<br>
Slowly introduced in class<br>
End of guidance from the sky<br>
Free to explore depths inside<br>
Life, Liberty & Happiness arrive<br>
From stars it's power derived<br>
Burdened tasks, burdened eyes<br>
Wreak havoc on our organic dyes<br>
Fellow companion to share the communion<br>
Silver & gold jewelry revel in holy union<br>
Hearts & minds align, congruent anchors we divine<br>
Cradling eager bundles of joy for a lifetime

Remnant impulse of the mind wanders<br>
Events of the past, in chains, it renders<br>
Divided into phases by certain days<br>
The weakest link withers yet the chain stays.

## Commentary

**Title: Scala Naturae** - Latin for "the great chain of being," reflecting the poem's theme of life as interconnected chains.

**The Chain Metaphor** - From the beginning, we are formed from DNA chains. Our chain of memory is what helps us persist and survive in this world. The poem explores how all aspects of life embody chains.

### The Five Life Stages

1. **Nascent Child** - The beginning of life, learning to express wants, taking first steps, family care
2. **Age of School** - Structured schedules, friendships, learning about the natural world (food chain)
3. **Age of Work/College** - Freedom arrives with American ideals (Life, Liberty & Happiness), stress affects our "organic dyes" (blood, sugar, cholesterol)
4. **Age of Marriage** - Finding a companion, union symbolized by gold chains (jewelry), creating offspring as "congruent anchors" (genes from parents, anchoring meaning to life)
5. **Old Age** - Memory becomes the chain linking past events

### Hidden Chain References

Each stanza contains a hidden reference to different types of chains:

- **First stanza**: Bicycle chain
- **Second stanza**: Food chain (Grass, deer, tiger, Grass)
- **Third stanza**: Nuclear chain reaction (star power - reference to US flag and nuclear fusion)
- **Fourth stanza**: Gold chains (jewelry)
- **Fifth stanza**: Memory chain / Markov chain (life as chain of events)

**The Moral** - Life is a single long line that people try to divide into phases with certain memories and events (first day of college, first day of work, day of marriage, death of loved one). All these are just human abstractions, not a conspiracy of life to divide your life into chained stages.

**"Congruent anchors"** - A euphemism for procreation. "Congruent" because offspring's genes come from parents; "anchor" because we use our offspring as reason to give meaning to life and work for them.
