Angel falls from the sky, a sight indeed for sore eyes<br>
Is truth what we see or what we see truth<br>
Struggle towards meaning or struggle for meaning<br>
Heap of heroes felled, deter not the living<br>
Almighty sees the earth, a sight indeed for sore eyes

Whence Shankara travelled, life's mystery unraveled<br>
Critique of pure reason, magnifies duality as treason<br>
Hedonists cry foul, for they love a soul<br>
Scientists mine patterns of primes, for the machine never chimes<br>
Hitherto in trance, resonating with music & dance<br>
Seek and ye shall find, doubt lurks in mind<br>
Have faith in thought, for it is wrought in<br>
Time that moves chaos to order.

Adoring auroras, the blind cannot<br>
Seek meaning, the mind cannot

## Commentary

**"Angel falls from the sky"** - A double reference to Nietzsche's nihilistic phrase "God is dead" and the natural beauty of Angel Falls in Venezuela. The phrase "a sight indeed for sore eyes" plays on this duality: a nihilist might rejoice at the death of angels, while the falls themselves are a beautiful sight that makes humans believe in something greater.

**Objective reality vs observed reality** - Is reality what we observe and make of it, or does objective truth exist independent of our perception? Do we contort reality to our preferences and biases? In life, are we trying to fit into society and contribute meaningfully, or is this all just a façade for our ultimate struggle to find meaning itself—a question we dare not confront?

**"Heap of heroes felled"** - A hidden reference to Chadwick Boseman, who died during the time this poem was written. Looking at legends who suffer, try, achieve, writhe, and die still does not discourage our ability to achieve in life. Neither do we readily think about having a child, though we know the child will ultimately die.

**The Almighty's perspective** - If the almighty were to see the earth, he would be surprised at our grit and determination to continue through all his plans of suffering and happiness.

**Adi Shankara** - The great Indian philosopher known for preaching Advaita (non-duality) philosophy—the realization that we are one with the universe. He traveled across India to debate and spread these ideas, founding modern Hinduism.

**Critique of Pure Reason** - Kant's book argues that we cannot understand true reality since we are not equipped for it at all.

**Hedonists** seek pleasure as the ultimate goal, believing only happiness enriches mind and soul.

**Scientists** remain skeptical yet always try to establish dominance over the universe by rooting out underlying patterns. "Pattern of primes" echoes the centuries-long struggle for humans and machines to compute and find prime patterns. "Chime" indicates the noise a machine makes when it finds something, and the attention it brings.

**The final meditation** - Even those who can see cannot truly adore auroras in their fullness; even the mind cannot fully seek or grasp meaning. Some mysteries remain beyond our reach.
