Hopping on the reddish yellow C line my first time<br>
Procured a seat in the crowded bus without a dime<br>
Coerced & world welcomed to unravel<br>
Glad for I had no other means of travel

Flood of people enter in stops ahead<br>
Throughout the bus like water they spread<br>
Some moving to the reserved front, others to the back<br>
Others lay quiet, while some constantly quack

The bus is bristling with diverse tones<br>
Shuffle of newspapers, taps on phones<br>
Polite few struggle to find a seat<br>
Impolite few never choose to accept defeat

I look out only to gaze back into the abyss inside<br>
For there is nowhere for the full moon to hide<br>
I share water with a parched fellow rider<br>
Enough to make our day and bond brighter

The bus climbs uphill, its vigor drops<br>
A digitized voice announces the stops<br>
I hold on to the strap; waiting for first law to impart<br>
Hopping off now for it is my time to depart

## Commentary

**Dual Narrative Structure** - This poem operates on two levels: a literal bus journey and a metaphorical journey through life, where the bus represents Earth itself.

### Literal Meaning: Bus Journey in Greater Seattle Area

The poem describes riding the C line bus, exploring new routes, interacting with diverse passengers, sharing moments of kindness (water with a fellow rider), and eventually reaching the destination.

### Parallel Hidden Meaning: The Journey of Life

**First Stanza - Birth Stage**
- **Reddish yellow** = Rising sun
- **C line** = C-section, referring to birth of a baby
- **Without a dime** = Coming into the world with nothing
- **Coerced & world welcomed** = Baby didn't ask to come to the world, yet is welcomed
- **Only means of travel** = As of today, Earth is our only means of life in the universe

**Second Stanza - Childhood Growth Stage**
- Massive increase in population, resulting wealth/health/opportunity gaps
- **Spread like water** = People quickly fill available space
- **Reserved front** = Disabled people/old people/pregnant women have reserved seating
- **Some quiet, some quack** = Different personality types navigating life

**Third Stanza - Adult Stage**
- **Diverse tones** = Different skin tones, people from different backgrounds living together
- **Newspapers, phones** = Absorbing information to become cognizant of the world
- **Polite few** = Those who live by principles of harmony and sharing
- **Impolite few** = Those who seek to win at any cost

**Fourth Stanza - Age of Spiritualism**
- Moving from materialism to spiritual contemplation
- **Full moon in night sky** = Life as a strong light in the darkness of meaninglessness
- **Sharing water** = Sharing resources cures the desolation of meaninglessness; we reinforce and give meaning to each other

**Fifth Stanza - Death of Life**
- **Bus climbing uphill, vigor drops** = Earth itself losing vigor (global warming, facing uphill battle)
- **First law** = "All living things die" - holding on to dear life, waiting for this law to apply
- **Time to depart** = Death arrives

The poem suggests that existence of life is a strong light in a universe of meaninglessness, and that sharing and human connection give meaning to our brief journey.
