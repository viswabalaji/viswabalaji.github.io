Move to wholesome fruits and food<br>
Fervent not on feasts of barley<br>
Clean bill of health is only brewed<br>
If balanced be your diet daily

Less travelled one; I always do choose<br>
Condensed food saves us time & famine<br>
Words upon which hell breaks loose<br>
For own cooked food is akin satin

Comes in square bars & colored shakes<br>
In flavors of apple, orange & pear<br>
Concise & content, my day it makes<br>
To consume without hassle & fear

Natural and artificial, our four other senses accept<br>
Explore with foresight for 'tis world we beget
