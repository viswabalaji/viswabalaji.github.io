An innocuous looking canteen, stands in stark colors of red and white<br>
Shaped in the form of a slender bottle or a cylindrical can, it contains a liquid<br>
Akin to its trait to fill out the physical void, this black gold also embraces mental voids

A refreshing drink at first, it quickly makes its way into my unbalanced diet<br>
Supplementing snacks sometimes, and sometimes eliminating them.<br>
A moment of dopamine filled happiness at first, it slowly imprints itself into my memories<br>
What is life re-imagined, if not a pastime of recollecting highs and lows? Perfectly encapsulated in the<br>
Temporary highs of stress relief to the mind, quickly followed by the temporary lows of sugary disbelief to the body<br>
Consequently, followed by the lip's burning desire to kiss the rim & the tongue's frenzy for fizz

Advice follows from all corners, to not drink from this fountain of youth and to forget<br>
For trepidation of poorer gums and ill-health it would beget<br>
Yet from no corner does the necessary accompaniment arise for my endeavors<br>
Endeavors that require verve, mastery and radical candor<br>
Left alone, I quietly rebound to this devilish enchanted drink<br>
For it alone in this digital future strives to honestly belie me to the brink
