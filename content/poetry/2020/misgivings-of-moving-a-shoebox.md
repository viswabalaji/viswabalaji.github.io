*In honor of William Yeats' birthday*

I write this overcoming my torpor, about a shoebox<br>
That arrived a fortnight ago at my doorstep, cradling my soft soled shoes<br>
It fit my firm feet with Cinderellaic magic<br>
Ecstatic and smug, I left the empty shoebox lying around in the living room.

Diligent in his duties, my flat mate has a peculiar appeal to material orderliness<br>
The solitary shoebox irked him as if it was Pandora's. "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" was his elucidation.<br>
My Taoist belief in the lasagna of order and chaos, hindered me to concur.

Fraught with concern, I dove head-first into a soliloquy: "To cede or not to cede",<br>
For I have equal dominion over the living room.<br>
Would moving the shoebox set a bad precedent? Is this him imposing his belief structure?

To a middle-class immigrant, a shoebox symbolizes opportunity.<br>
To protect oneself from unpaved cracked road, a sign of prosperity.<br>
Repurposing the box for crafts or growing plants, portrays creativity and mental alacrity.<br>
Recycling it for paper, portrays responsibility.<br>
Yet to an outsider, keeping a shoebox reeks of stupidity

Rife with melancholy, decided I have, to move the shoebox<br>
Out of his sight and his mind, but deep into my room and conscious memory<br>
For I settled to not have a box serve its didactic need.
