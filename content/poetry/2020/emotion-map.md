Freezing winter nights at West Lafayette, the clock ticks slow<br>
Though wind chills cradle the campus, the hearths still glow<br>
Filled with ambition, work & stress, my thoughts flow<br>
Probing deeper & deeper into existential throe<br>
Running out of limited time, for we cannot borrow

A knight with shining armor, arrives in swift<br>
Hoarding a nimbus of emotions, with all her grit<br>
With a key to unlock my inner emotional thrift<br>
For blessed she is with the art of grift<br>
To awaken my mind, stir my soul, only to drift

Anger did no good to anyone, needs to be shaken off<br>
Anticipation; soon we'll get better as a responsible society<br>
Surprise; beautiful as summer or cruel as the grave<br>
Disgust at the inadept care of our delicate planet

Trust not only the young's curiosity but the elderly's experience<br>
Fear not of constant change, for everything has changed<br>
Sadness is your doing, don't exile your success & positives<br>
Joy as pure from a boy playing in the streets of London

Now I stand by the window, attention back to the December sky<br>
Filled with stars outside and wonder inside<br>
For greyish notions have given way to colorful emotions<br>
By the alluring voice from my headphones

*Inspired by Taylor Swift's music*

## Commentary

**Setting: West Lafayette** - References Purdue University in Indiana, where temperatures fall as low as -40°F during winter. The poem captures the freezing winter nights and the intense academic environment.

**Taylor Swift as the Knight** - "A knight with shining armor, arrives in swift" - A wordplay on Taylor's last name. Her music serves as a key to unlock emotional awareness and empathy.

### Emotion Mappings to Taylor Swift Songs

Each emotion-focused stanza maps to specific Taylor Swift songs that evoke those feelings:

- **Anger** → "Shake It Off" (1989)
- **Anticipation** → "Soon You'll Get Better" (Lover)
- **Surprise** → "Cruel Summer" (Lover)
- **Disgust** → "Delicate" (reputation)
- **Trust** → "Only the Young" (Miss Americana)
- **Fear** → "Everything Has Changed" (Red)
- **Sadness** → "Exile" (Folklore)
- **Joy** → "London Boy" (Lover)
- **Final Stanza** → "Back to December" (Speak Now)

**The Transformation** - The poem captures Taylor Swift's ability to enable individuals to experience a range of emotions in a short period of time. The poet usually spends hours contemplating life and philosophy, but Taylor's songs made them more empathetic to emotions and thinking from someone else's shoes. Hence the transformation from "greyish notions" (of philosophy) to "colorful emotions" (of highs and lows in life).
