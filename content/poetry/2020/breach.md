+++

Knee numbing pain, yet I firmly stand<br>
Waiting for tears to breach the hood<br>
Truth to be told, for if it even exists<br>
Would shatter hearts, hearts that relentlessly persist

O'tis a heavenly drop that descends<br>
Trio of sanctity, morality, duality<br>
Friendly fingers reach out from atop<br>
Promising soul's suffering to stop<br>
Futile attempts to repeatedly reach,<br>
Hitherto resoundingly breached

Guilt, anger, emotions high<br>
Ego hurt, "another turn" it cries<br>
Faith beholden, back to origin<br>
Pity, the rigged game's rules still remain<br>
Doubt the game not your ability<br>
For only then evil evolves creativity

Puppet masters unfrozen, cast in flames<br>
Back breaking burden of bundled blames<br>
Falls to singing canaries who seek to carry<br>
Weeping Atlas shrugs weight, shifting gait<br>
Never mooring about past states

For I cannot reach, but only breach.
