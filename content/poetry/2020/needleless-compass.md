**[Religion]**<br>
Let there be light, God proclaimed<br>
His children run around ashamed<br>
Yielding crops until backs break<br>
Warring until sister faiths shake<br>
Earning goodwill day and night<br>
The only path to heavenly right

**[Philosophy]**<br>
Let there be light, Kant conceived<br>
For 'tis an image we can't perceive<br>
Stoic slogans, though profound to hear<br>
Hard to practice out of selfish fear<br>
To bear you children for the state<br>
For only a philosopher king is great

**[Science]**<br>
Let there be light, science theorized<br>
Protons shot out of dense fire and ice<br>
Shrunk into galaxies by weak gravity<br>
Sentient systems evolved to clarity<br>
Devoted to uncover the hidden puzzle<br>
Of the ever expanding realm of Hubble

**[Art]**<br>
Let there be light, Leo exclaimed<br>
Pointing to the little candle's flame<br>
Brush in hand soaked with color<br>
Deftly touching her smile of valor<br>
Humans & heavens hustle together<br>
Golden ratios spring from nether<br>
Time pruned stories remain seated<br>
In curls of the head they are repeated
