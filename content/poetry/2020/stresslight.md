The starry sky smiled down from its heavenly abode,<br>
The delicate moonlight filtered its way through bushes and thickets,<br>
Silence enveloped the landscape.

He stood leaning on his car, watching the waning moon traverse the northern sky.<br>
His dry lips were hungry, yearning for more moisture.

Miniature lights dotted the other faraway mountain side,<br>
but the moon outshone them. Stress outshone the moon.<br>
The moon's twin shimmered and swam through Lake Ashi,<br>
The stress' twin was vacillating pressure, dark circles, under deep eye-orbit.

Silence felt new to him, so did the sound of his throat and chest.<br>
His vacation had done some good to his peace of mind.<br>
The moon covered itself in grand robes of dark clouds,<br>
a sense of hope trickled down from heaven into the man, the moon's twin disappeared.<br>
Retina was flooded with darkness.

Splash of water sounded, the moon returned to its original lively form,<br>
he caught sight of a fish falling into the water.<br>
He had made up his mind, he would go back to his country with renewed vigour and energy.<br>
The sakura trees reminded him of palm trees at his birthplace. Ashi resembled eternity.<br>
He was the fish, the same fish which had gone up in the darkness, crashed down in the water in limelight.<br>
Stronger his form became,<br>
Sharper his senses became,<br>
Lighter his burden became.
