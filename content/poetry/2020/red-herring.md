Rolling rocks up the unfinished hill<br>
Marching time stands still<br>
I tire and tire breaking down boulders<br>
Oh my poor faint head and shoulders

Twisting and turning in creased sheets<br>
Problems, solutions arrive in fleets<br>
Hollow soliloquies audible voices speak<br>
"Fear not for the almighty is romantic"

Wishes flowing from womb to will<br>
O'Lord I wish time stood still<br>
Innate instincts push us ahead<br>
Societal standards pull us ahead<br>
Stuck in between I wax and wane<br>
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain

Racing mind hangs, the eye lids droop<br>
Sleep takes over me in one fell swoop<br>
Breathing in, breathing out, the body resounds<br>
In silent preparation for the next few rounds
