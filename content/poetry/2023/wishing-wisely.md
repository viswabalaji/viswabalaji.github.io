Do you ever wish for ghosts?<br>
Careful, you may not find them<br>
Careful, you may unshroud the mystery of darkness

In the middle of the night, as I lie awake in bed alone<br>
I wonder if a ghost would visit my home<br>
I wonder if I can summon one at will…<br>
Why? Perhaps it's proof that time stands still

Feels easier to summon a Ghost than a God.<br>
Isn't seeing one sufficient proof the other exists?

Even if I could just spot a little demon with its tiny fangs, bony wings, bated breath<br>
The fabricated reality of society would persist

But would baby ghosts be accompanied by their mothers?<br>
Be accompanied by lovers in everlasting tryst?

Maybe a gentle tug at the bedsheet on my right knee<br>
A force without cause would be joyful to see

Could I at least hear a screech or a scream or a whisper or a whine?<br>
Anything for an action or reaction that sends shivers down my spine

…

Dutifully; the morning rays of the sun peek through the blinds<br>
Right into my dry eyes, only then I blink

Should I live now? Or in the minds of others later? Hard to decide<br>
A question of influence & power, I think

For then certainly the Gods and Ghosts will outlive my pride.
