Winding trail in the mountain side<br>
Swishing around the deciduous trees<br>
Sweet fragrance of rusty rain soil<br>
Lurching my feet ahead in eager toil

Shrubs reclaiming the lost land<br>
A hush falls over the scene<br>
Chirping birds fly to the rainbow<br>
Serendipitous stumps deride me

"Ever been to this peak, mate?"<br>
I recall being asked and asked<br>
"Oh I will soon, my time shall come"<br>
I respond, till my voice is lost

Time passes as I wait for the time<br>
Like puffed pillows on empty beds<br>
Lonely path filled with obstacles ahead<br>
Fantasies dreamed; turn dark and dead

Huffing and puffing, you reach the top<br>
Alas! You realize it's only a primordial drop<br>
Unconquered oceans, lie ahead in wait<br>
Shoulders loose and eyes straight, I ask<br>
"Ever been to that peak, mate?"
